There are **10 models total** (including the o4-mini at the bottom).

Best options :

GPT-5 (Preview) →

Most advanced among GPT models.

Great for code explanation, debugging, and generating backend logic.

Strong reasoning, can help with architecture and frameworks (Spring Boot, Hibernate, etc.).

Claude Sonnet 3.7 or 4 →

Good for code reasoning and reading long files.

Useful if you have large Java classes/config files since Claude handles bigger contexts well.

Grok Code Fast 1 (Preview) →

Optimized for code tasks.

Faster for generating snippets, refactoring, and debugging.

May be handy for repetitive coding tasks but less powerful in deep reasoning than GPT-5.

GPT-5 mini (Preview) →

Lightweight and fast.

Good for smaller backend snippets or quick API calls.

Not as strong for complex project-level guidance.
